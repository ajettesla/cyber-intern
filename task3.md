🔍 Why Investigate Unusual Port Traffic?
In cybersecurity, most legitimate network traffic occurs over well-known ports—HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), and RDP (3389). When a system starts communicating over uncommon ports, it often signals:

Stealthy backdoor access

Malware attempting to evade detection

Data exfiltration

Port scanning & reconnaissance activities

Attackers and defenders both pay close attention to traffic on unusual ports to uncover hidden threats.

👨‍💻 How Attackers Exploit Unusual Ports
1️⃣ Reverse Shells Over High-Numbered Ports
A skilled hacker rarely uses default ports for persistence. Instead, they configure reverse shells to communicate on random, high-numbered ports (49152–65535). This avoids detection from firewalls restricting default ports.

2️⃣ Covert Channels for Data Exfiltration
Sensitive data can be exfiltrated using non-standard ports. For example:

plaintext
- DNS tunneling (port `53` used improperly)
- Custom encrypted channels (`54321`)
- HTTP traffic disguised over an obscure port (`8088`)
Network admins typically ignore traffic over unknown ports, making this an ideal method for attackers to siphon data unnoticed.

3️⃣ Beaconing Malware & C2 Traffic
Advanced malware and Command-and-Control (C2) servers communicate on unusual ports to stay under the radar. Threat actors modify their botnet’s connection settings:

plaintext
Malware -> Victim Machine -> Port 4444 (Custom C2 Channel)
🔧 How Hackers & Defenders Detect Unusual Ports
Using tools like Splunk, attackers AND defenders analyze network traffic patterns to catch strange connections. A typical search might look like this:

splunk
index=* | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port
| where NOT (dest_port=80 OR dest_port=443 OR dest_port=22 OR dest_port=3389)
| where NOT (cidrmatch("224.0.0.0/4", src_ip) OR cidrmatch("ff00::/8", src_ip) OR cidrmatch("224.0.0.0/4", dest_ip) OR cidrmatch("ff00::/8", dest_ip))
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, count
✅ Excludes common ports ✅ Filters multicast IPs ✅ Detects traffic on suspicious ports
