Unauthorized Access Attempt

The image below illustrates detection of login attempts occurring outside of regular office hours. This type of traffic can indicate unauthorized access attempts and is a common red flag in security audits.

Note: The data used here is simulated traffic, generated specifically for testing purposes. We used custom logs to emulate unauthorized login behavior outside normal working hours.

You can find the tool used to generate this test data in the logGen repository on GitHub.
